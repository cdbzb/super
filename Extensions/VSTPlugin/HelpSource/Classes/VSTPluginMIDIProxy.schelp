TITLE:: VSTPluginMIDIProxy
summary:: MIDI interface for VSTPluginController
categories:: Server>Abstractions
related:: Classes/VSTPluginController, Classes/VSTPlugin

DESCRIPTION::
This class mimicks the interface of link::Classes/MIDIOut::, so you don`t have to send raw MIDI messages.

Every link::Classes/VSTPluginController:: instance has its own VSTPluginMIDIProxy instance that you can access with link::Classes/VSTPluginController#-midi::.

It is used internally by link::Classes/Pbind::s of link::Classes/Event:: type code::\vst_midi:: (see link::Classes/VSTPluginController#Sequencing::), but it can also be used for playing a VSTi with a MIDI keyboard, for manually scheduling MIDI events in a Routine, etc.

See link::Classes/VSTPluginController#VST Instruments:: for some usage examples.

warning::This class is strong::not:: a drop-in replacement for MIDIOut!
More specifically, it is not meant to be used with the code::\midi:: Event type. Instead, use the dedicated code::\vst_midi:: Event type mentioned above.
::

CLASSMETHODS::

PRIVATE:: new

INSTANCEMETHODS::

All methods have a corresponding code::*Msg:: version which returns a raw OSC message, so they can be scheduled as bundles.

PRIVATE:: latency, owner, uid

METHOD:: noteOn

ARGUMENT:: chan
the MIDI channel

ARGUMENT:: note
the pitch

ARGUMENT:: veloc
the velocity

DISCUSSION::
The pitch argument does not have to be an Integer, it can also be a fractional value (= microtonal)!

code::
~vst.midi.noteOn(0, 60.5, 100); // play quarter tone between c4 and c#4
::

note:: This is not part of the MIDI standard and not all VST instruments actually support it!::

strong::Tip::: SFZ samplers like emphasis::sfizz:: or emphasis::sforzando:: do support microtonal playback.
