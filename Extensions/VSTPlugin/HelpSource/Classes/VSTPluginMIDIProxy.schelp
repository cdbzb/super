TITLE:: VSTPluginMIDIProxy
summary:: MIDI interface for VSTPluginController
categories:: Server->Abstractions
related:: Classes/VSTPluginController, Classes/VSTPlugin

DESCRIPTION::
This class mimicks the interface of link::Classes/MIDIOut::, so you don`t have to send raw MIDI messages.

Instances are obtained with link::Classes/VSTPluginController#-midi::. You should never need to create instances of this class yourself!

It is used internally by link::Classes/Pbind::s of event type code::\vst_midi:: (see link::Classes/VSTPluginController#Sequencing::), but it can be used in other situations as well, e.g. for playing a VSTi with a MIDI keyboard.

note::
MIDI pitches can be Floats! The fractional part is converted to cents and passed as the code::detune:: argument to link::#-sendMidi::. This is not part of the MIDI standard and not all VST instruments actually support it!
::

All methods have a corresponding code::*Msg:: version which returns a raw OSC message, so they can be scheduled as bundles.
