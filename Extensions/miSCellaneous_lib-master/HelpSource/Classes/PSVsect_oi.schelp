DESCRIPTION::
Pattern for intersection of integer generators with offsets and interval output. Corresponds to Sieve's methods link::Classes/Sieve#*sect_oi:: and link::Classes/Sieve#-sect_oi::. For an introduction and more examples see link::Tutorials/Sieves_and_Psieve_patterns::.



CLASSMETHODS::


method::new

Creates a new PSVsect_oi object.

argument::genList
An array of generators and corresponding offsets. 
Allowed generators: Integers, Streams or Patterns producing intervals or Sieves itself.
Integers and Stream/Pattern output must be strictly positive. 
Integers as generators produce constant intervals.
Offsets must be integers.

argument::maxLength
Integer. Maximum number of items, which the stream will return.
Defaults to inf.

argument::limit
Integer. Limit up to which intervals can be returned by the stream.
If no limit is passed, integer intervals might be returned up to default summation limit of 65536.


SECTION::Examples

code::
p = PSVsect_oi([10, 31, 50, 1], 20)

p.asStream.nextN(15)


a = Sieve(4, 20)

q = PSVsect_oi([a, 20, 10, 0], 5)

q.asStream.all


r = PSVsect_oi([a, 20, 10, 0], limit: 25)

r.asStream.all
