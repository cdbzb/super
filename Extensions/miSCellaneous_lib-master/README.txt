miSCellaneous - a library of SuperCollider extensions (c) 2009-2020 Daniel Mayer 
======================================================================================

Version 0.24 contains these class and help files (SCDoc and old HTML system):


1.	Guide "Introduction to miSCellaneous": recommended starting point.

2.	VarGui:  a slider / player gui to set envir variables and synth controllers and 
	play synths, event patterns and tasks, see also "VarGui shortcut builds".
	"HS with VarGui", a specific tutorial about the combination of HS family and VarGui.

3.	General tutorials: "Event patterns and LFOs" contains an overview of
	related LFO-control setups with event patterns. "Event patterns and Functions" 
	is treating requirements of the control of EventStreamPlayers with VarGui.
	"Event patterns and array args" focusses on passing arrays to synths with patterns.
	"enum" is a general enumeration method suited for many combinatorial problems such as 
	listing subsets, partitions of integers, searching for paths within graphs etc.

4.	"PLx suite", dynamic scope variants of common Pattern classes for convenient 
	replacement. Can be used for shorter writing of Pbinds to be played with VarGui 
	and / or live coding, see "PLx and live coding with Strings".
	PLbindef and PLbindefPar as subclasses of Pdef allow replacement of 
	key streams in shortcut pseudomethod syntax.

5.	PSx stream patterns, Pattern variants that have a state and can remember their 
	last values. Can be used for recording streams and event streams (PS),
	data sharing between event streams (PSdup), comfortable defining of subpatterns
	with counted embedding, defining of recursive (event) sequences (PSrecur) and
	building loops on given Patterns/Streams with a variety of options, also for 
	live interaction (PSrecur).

6.	Event pattern classes for use with effects: PbindFx can handle arbitrary effect
	graphs per event, PmonoPar and PpolyPar follow the Pmono paradigm. 
	The tutorial "kitchen studies" contains the documented source code of a 
	fixed media piece using PbindFx for granulation.
	
7.	Further Pattern classes: PlaceAll, Pshufn, PsymNilSafe.
	PSPdiv is a dynamic multi-layer pulse divider based on Pspawner.

8.	"Buffer Granulation", a tutorial covering different approaches of implementing
	this synthesis method in SC (server versus language control, mixed forms),
	examples with VarGui, language-driven control with PLx suite patterns.
	The tutorial "Live Granulation" summarizes direct options without 
	explicit use of a buffer.
	
9.	A family of classes for the use of synth values in Pbind-like objects.
	Take Working with HS and HSpar as a starting point, see also
	HS, PHS, PHSuse, HSpar, PHSpar, PHSparUse, PHSplayer, PHSparPlayer, PHSusePlayer.

10.	EventShortcuts, a class for user-defined keywords for events and event patterns.
	The tutorial "Other event and pattern shortcuts" collects some further abbreviations,
	e.g. functional reference within events and event patterns, similar to Pkey.

11.	An implementation of Xenakis' Sieves as class and pattern family, see
	"Sieves and Psieve patterns" for an overview and examples. 
	
12.	FFT pseudo ugens for defining ranges by bin index: PV_BinRange and PV_BinGap.
	
13.	Smooth Clipping and Folding, a suite of pseudo ugens.	
	
14.	DX, a suite of pseudo ugens for crossfaded mixing and fanning according to
	demand-rate control. 
	
15.	Idev suite, patterns and drate ugen searching for numbers with integer distance from a 
	source pattern / signal.
	
16.	Nonlinear dynamics: Fb1 for single sample feedback / feedforward and GFIS for 
	generalized functional iteration synthesis.
	Fb1_ODE for ordinary differential equation integration. 
	
17.	ZeroXBufWr, ZeroXBufRd, TZeroXBufRd: pseudo ugens for analysis of zero crossings and 
	playing sequences of segments between them with demand rate control. Dwalk, a 	
	pseudo demand rate ugen that supports specific synthesis options with ZeroXBufRd.
	
			 
Many of the examples here are using patterns, resp. event patterns but do not cover 
their basic concepts. For a detailled description of SC's sequencing capabilities see 
James Harkins' Practical Guide to Patterns (PG_01_Introduction), the tutorial 
Streams-Patterns-Events (1-7) and the Pattern help files 
(Pattern, Pbind and the type-specific ones).

VarGui handles namespace separation by using different Environments.
So a gui for control of parametrized families of different types of objects can be 
built on the fly (e.g. a number of EventStreamPlayers from a single Pbind definition 
with snippets of functional code, a number of Function plots from a single 
parametric function definition etc.).
See Environment and Event helpfiles for the underlying concepts and 
"Event patterns and Functions" and "PLx suite" for their application to 
event patterns resp. EventStreamPlayers.


Requirements

At least SuperCollider version 3.6 but newer versions are recommended, 
with 3.6 you'd have to use Qt GUI kit, which is the only option anyway from 3.7 onwards. 
Unable to test on 3.5 anymore, code might work, anyway old help is still supported.

If you still use Cocoa or SwingOSC with these old SC versions,
you can take miSCellaneous 0.15b and add classes and help files from a 
newer version of miSCellaneous.

For using VarGui with EZSmoothSlider and EZRoundSlider you would need to 
install Wouter Snoei's wslib Quark, one buffer granulation
example using Wavesets depends on Alberto de Campo's Wavesets Quark. 

I tested examples on SC versions 3.6 - 3.11, 
on OS 10.8 - 10.13, Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7, 10; 
though not every platform / OS version / SC version combination.


SCDoc issues (SC 3.10)

With SC 3.10.0 - SC 3.10.2 there are issues with evaluating code in the 
help file examples (double evaluation).
For these versions you'd rather copy the help file code 
into scd files and run it there. 
Double evaluation has been fixed with 3.10.3 (August 2019).
With SC updates to 3.10 it might happen that help file examples are invisible.
In that case delete the Help folder which resides in one of these places, depending
where you have installed:

Platform.userAppSupportDir;
Platform.systemAppSupportDir;

Then restart SC.


Installation

By version 0.17 you can install either via the quarks extension management system or a 
downloaded zip from GitHub or my website.
Both methods shouldn't be combined, e.g. if you have already done a manual install 
before by placing a miSCellaneous folder in the Extensions folder, then remove 
it from there before the quarks install.

1.) Installation via Quarks

This requires a SC version >= 3.7, see the recommended ways to install here:

http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/UsingQuarks.html
https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/quarks

After a install of a newer version of miSCellaneous do a SCDoc update by

SCDoc.indexAllDocuments(true)


2.) Manual installation from a downloaded zip

You can download the newest version from 

https://github.com/dkmayer/miSCellaneous_lib

and the newest and all previous versions from here:

http://daniel-mayer.at

Copy the miSCellaneous folder into the Extensions folder and recompile 
the class library or (re-)start SC. If the Extensions folder doesn't exist 
you'd probably have to create it yourself. Check SC help for platform-specific 
conventions (or changes) of extension places.

Typical user-specific extension directories:

OSX:	~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/
Linux:	~/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/

Typical system-wide extension directories:

OSX:	/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/
Linux:	/usr/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/

You can check Extension directories with

Platform.userExtensionDir;
Platform.systemExtensionDir;

On Windows see the README file of SC for the recommended extensions path.
On Windows and OSX you might have to make the concerned folders visible,
if they aren't already. The miSCellaneous folder should be placed directly
into the Extensions folder, not into a subfolder.

After a install of a newer version of miSCellaneous do a SCDoc update by

SCDoc.indexAllDocuments(true)
