** more modular RPP builder
** TODO Stills [2/6]
    - [ ] make Stills toggleable at the Song level
         try using //Stills tag like with RPP ??
         there are some good things about using a Class though - we can alter the monitor etc
         of course we can do that in the Stills class I think
    - [ ] global monitor selection
    - [X] (how do I know which machine? in /etc ?) *Platform.machine
    - [ ] make Stills exportable !!
    - [X] explore making a Still class for individual still (could then have a .export method)
** TODO copy more synthDefs to the library!
 SCHEDULED  <2021-09-16 Thu> 
    - [ ] OR just generalize some of the existing ?? to make sort of "big" synths
* presentation ideas 
** Idea: make a method of song that renders out a section:
   - still
   - music
**    - invoke ffmpeg to make a short .mov
