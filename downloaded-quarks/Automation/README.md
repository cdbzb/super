This is a "Quark", a plugin for the supercollider audio synthesizer software.  
See: https://supercollider.github.io

To learn how to use this, first read about Quarks in general,  
and install the Automation Quark in your supercollider instance.

Detailed usage information for Automation is then found in Help/Automation.scd,
with super collider code examples found inline, as usual with supercollider.

I would like to know what you're using Automation for: drop me a mail! :)
