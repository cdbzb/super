The ixi quarks environment is a simple visual system presenting a high entry-level control over synthesis, live input and samples using the SuperCollider language.

Download SuperCollider first and then use ixi quarks.


If you are new to all this here are the basic instructions:

SuperCollider is here:
http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/

ixi quarks are here:
https://github.com/ixiaudio/ixiquarks

You also need the sc3-plugins from here:
http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/ (choose the Universal Binary)

1) Put SuperCollider somewhere on your system.
2) Start SuperCollider.
3) You will now have a SuperCollider folder within your "~/Library/Application Support/" folder.
4) Create an "Extensions" folder in there and drop the ixiquark classes into that folder.
5) Drag the sc3-plugins folder into the "Extensions" folder as well.
6) Quit and start SuperCollider again and boot the server that is "default" (you can choose either).
7) Type XiiQuarks() in a new SC document (Apple+N) and evaluate that line (with the cursor in it) with SHIFT+RETURN (buttons pressed in that order)
8) Now follow the instructions of ixi quarks in the XiiQuarks.html helpfile.
