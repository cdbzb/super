The the buffers can be read into the pool from any location         and be saved as one pool. The &quot;view&quot; button allows you to view         the buffer and play it. The &quot;save&quot; button makes it possible         to save the buffer pool (the filenames, not the sounds) so it can be easily         loaded up again later.</p>      <p>The &quot;r&quot; button makes visible the recording functionality of         the buffer pool. Here you can record sound straight into the pool to be         used seconds later. The recording functionality is the same as the &quot;Recorder&quot;         tool.</p>      <p>By hitting &quot;view&quot; or ENTER on a selected soundfile, you can         view the waveform of the buffer (the file) and choose start and end point         of the buffer. That way, other instruments will know which part of the         buffer you have selected and want to use.</p>      <p>On the top of the window, you can see the memory of the pool itself (&quot;RAM         use&quot;) and the memory taken up by each sound file.</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
