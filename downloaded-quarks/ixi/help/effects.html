There is         normally an effect level and a dry level in each effect, allowing you         to mix the original sound out with the effect output. </p>      <p>The effects can be added at the head of an audio channel (so it's located         at the top of the audio stream) or at the tail of it (where it filters         everything that goes through the channel).</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
