On the left side         there are categories for what kind of tools you want to use. When you         have selected a category, you get the specific tools under that category         listed in the right list view. You can switch between views with the TAB         button.</p>      <p>Use the stereo or mono radio-buttons to define whether the tool is 1         or 2 channel.</p>      <p>The &quot;f&quot; button will open up the folder where sounds are recorded.</p>      <p>On the bottom-left there is functionality to store settings. Load up         your instruments, effects and filters, arrange them on the screen and         then store the setting. You can retrieve that setting at any point.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><strong>Study 2 - The bufferPool</strong></p>      <p>The <a href="bufferpool.html">bufferPool</a> is perhaps the most important         utility of the ixiQuarks. This is the tool you use to load in your soundsamples.         It loads samples into RAM, so for longer sounds it might be better to         use the Player.</p>      <p>Choose the sounds that you want to import (you can select many at the         time) and load them. When loaded, you can view the sound by hitting RETURN         or ENTER, and you can select a part of the sound to be used in the other         instruments (such as the SoundScratcher). You can record (by hitting the         &quot;r&quot; button) into the bufferPool as well by opening up the AudioIn         tool and send the audio out on any bus and then record from that bus into         the bufferPool.</p>      <p>Now, when you have some sounds in the bufferPool, load up some instruments,         such as the <a href="soundscratcher.html">SoundScratcher</a> and perform         with the sounds. </p>      <p>You can use as many bufferPools as you want at any one time and you can         save the state of the bufferPool in the PoolManager so you don't have         load the sounds in again, you just load the named bufferPool. Settings         in the ixiQuarks menu will also store locations and the content of the         bufferPools.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><strong>Study 3 - AudioIn and Recording</strong></p>      <p>To route Audio in from Mic or Line-in, open the <a href="audioin.html">AudioIn</a>         tool. To get it straight to the speakers, use audio busses 0 and 1 (left         and right). If you want to route the audio through some effects or into         instruments choose a bus and listen to it in the respective bus on the         instrument. </p>      <p>Recording is simple. Using the <a href="recorder.html">Recorder</a>,         you choose the bus to record from and the file will appear in the sounds/ixiquarks         folder inside your application. The quarks GUI has a button &quot;f&quot;         that opens up that sounds folder. You can of course use the <a href="bufferpool.html">bufferPool</a>         to record sounds directly into the pool. (this will load them into RAM         for use with other instruments AND store them in the sounds folder).</p>      <p>To view the signal choose any of the views that you're interested in:         (<a href="freqscope.html">Frequency Scope</a>, <a href="wavescope.html">Wave         Scope</a> or <a href="eqmeter.html">EQ Meter</a>).</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><strong>Study 4 - StratoSampler</strong></p>      <p>The <a href="stratosampler.html">StratoSampler</a> instrument records         incoming signal and layers it on top of the older signal. The preLevel         slider defines how much of the older signal you are keeping. The recLevel         slider is just the recording level coming in from the audio-in. If preLevel         is 1 and recLevel 0 you will get a sound that loops infinitively.</p>      <p> The default inbus is 8 and 9 which are the default inbusses of ixiQuarks.         Using the &quot;write&quot; button, the sound is written to the ixiquarks         sounds folder and it is registered as a sample in the bufferPool. This         allows you to use the sampled sound immediately in the other instruments.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><strong>Study 5 - Using MIDI with effects and filters</strong></p>      <p>There is a basic MIDI support for controlling sliders in the graphical         user interface of the effects and filters. Each MIDI device has different         MIDI control numbers and in order for ixiQuarks to know the controller         numbers of your device, you have to provide that information in the preferences.ixi         file.</p>      <p>But first, you have to find the control numbers of your sliders. Open         the preferences file and follow the instructions at the bottom of the         file. </p>      <p>One controller is used to switch between windows, the others used to         control sliders.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><strong>Study 6- Testing sound and effects... and saving the setting</strong></p>      <p>To test the most basic effect routing setup, try loading up the <a href="quanoon.html">Quanoon</a>         instrument, choose outbus 20 and 21 and then load up any effect such as         the delay or reverb. Try to use many effects and route from one into another.       </p>      <p>When this is working, name your preset and press the &quot;store&quot;         button. You have now stored this preset and you can load it up at any         time. To try it, press &quot;clear&quot; and then &quot;load&quot; your         preset again. </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      </td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
