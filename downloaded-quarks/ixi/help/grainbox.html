The problem with granular synthesis is often how to represent       it graphically at the interface level as there are so many parameters involved.       Here we represent the parameters with coloured boxes in a two dimensional       space where boxes with related parameters are connected with lines. This       makes it easy for the musician to intuitively understand the state of the       sound engine by quickly glancing at the interface, as opposed to the complex       analysis of slider positions where one has to read the label of each slider.<br>       <br>      The audio stream of the GrainBox can be output on any audio bus and used       as the source sound fed into and controlled by other instruments such as       PolyMachine, Gridder or Predators. This way, the sound can be directly adjusted       from the GrainBox application but utilised by the other pattern generating       instruments that wrap the sound in an envelope. Of course, the GrainBox       can also be used independently as sound texture generator.</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
