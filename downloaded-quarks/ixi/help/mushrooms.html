The         onset detection can be done in either the time domain or the frequency         domain (FFT). It depends very much on the sound analysed which method         is better. There is a thresh variable that defines the thresholds of the         detection. The minGap variable decides how far away each onset is in the         time domain analysis. If it is very low, there will be more events and         closer together. </p>      <p><br>        The analysis is either done in the time domain (analysis of samples in         the buffer), where the sound does not have to be played during the analysis,         or through the frequency domain (where Fast Fourier Transform is used         to find the onsets) and here the sound has to be played during analysis.</p>      <p><br>        The playback rate of the sound can be controlled. The volume of the sample         can be adjusted and so can the volume of the onset events.</p>      <p><br>        And that's the main point of the software: to detect the onsets in a musical         signal and trigger other events from them. The user can choose buffers         to analyse from the buffer pool drop down menus on the top left, but then         there are various different ways to map the onsets, such as a few synthesis         types, writing code, triggering samples or triggering envelopes of audio         stream that runs on silent busses (i.e. audio busses that are not going         out to the sound system).</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
