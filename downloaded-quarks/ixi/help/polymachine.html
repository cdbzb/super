The instrument originates from a         study of Indian talas but turned into a parody of the typical drum sequencer.         <br>        <br>        The PolyMachine consists of 4 tracks where the number of steps in each         track can be defined individually. One can view the instrument either         with a fixed boxsize where the GUI window grows in size or a relative         boxsize where the tracks adjust to the size of the window. Both modes         have different qualities to them and it can be interesting to study the         conceptual understanding of time and rhythm in the different representational         modes.<br>        <br>        Each track has a time indicator that travels above the sequence line and         triggers an event if the box is selected. The event can be triggering         of a sound sample or a any function that SuperCollider can evaluate, such         as synthesis or sending OSC messages to other environments or applications.         The tracks have volume control and an envelope generator (for instance         if the sound samples are too long).</p>      <p>The boxes can trigger samples from Buffer Pools, sc code (that can be         live-coded while the machine is running) and audio stream that is running         on any audio channel. Amplitude envelopes can be set for each channel.</p>      <p>To open up the sc code window, click on a box while holding down CTRL         on your keyboard.</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
