They loose energy by not eating from the preys or         by fighting about them. When a predator takes a bite of the prey, it emits         a sound. The sound is either synthesized sound or samples from the buffer         pool. The pitch of the sound is defined either by the vertical location         of the prey or by assigning a special pitch to the prey by choosing a         note from a keyboard that pops up. Of course, preys and predators can         be added to or removed from the environment. The ALife properties of this         instrument are rather simple. We could have added things like environmental         obstacles, age, death, reproduction, etc. but we did not find that it         would serve any musical purpose in this simple instrument.</p>      <p>There are various synths available from a popup menu, but most noteable         are the <strong>scode</strong> synth where the user can live-code synths         in realtime and the <strong>audiostream</strong> where you can stream         in audio from any running bus and have the predators triggering those         sounds.</p>      <p>Fixed Pitch/Relative Pitch means that each prey has a frequency that         is either fixed (and you can define which frequency it has) or relative         to it's vertical location.</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
