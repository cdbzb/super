Any buffer stored in RAM can be manipulated         by the instrument. The instrument receives input from hardware such as         the mouse or a Wacom tablet and the basic idea is that the user can draw         on top of the waveform representation and control the playback of the         sound that way.<br>      </p>      <p>There are various interactive modes in which the user can play with the         sound: <br>        <strong>warp</strong> &#150; a granular synthesis where the location in         the sound file is played constantly using overlapping soundgrains. Here         the vertical location of the cursor represents the pitch; <br>        <strong>scratch</strong> &#150; by moving the pen (or some other sensor         input) the user can scratch the buffer forwards and backwards like a needle         on a turntable. In the spirit of turntables, the speed of the gestural         movement maps naturally to the pitch;<br>        <strong>random grains</strong> &#150; here grains are represented as dots         on the canvas. The sound engine reads randomly though an array of the         locations of those dots, creating a granular cloud. The density of the         cloud, the envelope length and envelope type of each grain can be controlled         from the interface;<br>        <strong>linear grains</strong> &#150; same functionality as in random         grains, but here the sound engine reads linearly through the list of grains.         However, there is a randomising button on the left of the interface where         you can randomise the list if you so wish. These settings can be stored         using the &quot;save&quot; button and retrieved from the &quot;settings&quot;         drop down menu.<br>        <strong>worm</strong> &#150; the worm is a creature that moves over the         space of the sound with variable numbers of grains in its spine. The speed         of the worm and the grain duration can be controlled; Press &quot;a&quot;         to add grains to the tail of the worm and &quot;s&quot; to remove grains         (or number of dots).<br>        <strong>graincircles</strong> &#150; these are circles of variable size         and amplitude (represented as alpha in colour) inside which the sound         engine spawns grains according to the set speed. Again the envelope and         duration of the grain can be controlled. Press the Z key to UNDO (if you 
        create a circle that you didn't like). <br>        <strong>grainsquares</strong> &#150; as opposed to the graincircles the         squares always play the grains from the left point of its location. This         makes it easier to create interesting rhythms and periodic sound textures         than in the random space of the circles. The speed of the grain repetition         can be affected in both the graincircles and the grainsquares by pressing         the 1, 2, 3, or 4 number keys, representing the respective time relationships         (3 against 2 or 4 against 3, etc.) Press the Z key to UNDO (if you 
        create a circle that you didn't like). <br>      </p>      <p>We recommend using the Wacom tablet here as the instrument is more expressive         this way, i.e. pressure on the tablet is translated to amplitude control         of the soundgrains/scratch.</p>      <p><br>        The gestural movements of the user can be recorded, stored and played         back by the instrument itself. (the record/play path button has 4states:         &quot;prepare recording&quot;, &quot;record&quot;, &quot;recording&quot;,         and &quot;play&quot; - it has these states in order for the user to trigger         the recording from the SPACE button on the keyboard). That way the user         can draw patterns on the instrument and leave it to perform on its own.         The user could then for example open up another instance of Soundscratcher         to perform with.</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
