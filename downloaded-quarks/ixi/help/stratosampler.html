The sound can be recorded on top of the sound that exists         there already, so it creates an overlay on the older sound. The preLevel         parameter defines how fast the sound fades out. The recLevel is the gain         of the incoming signal.</p>      <p><br>        The software opens up by default on audio busses 8 and 9 (the default         AudioIn busses of ixiQuarks). </p>      <p><br>        On start the buffer is a 2 second mono file. The buffer length can be         changed from 0.1 second to 10 seconds. When the &quot;new/clear&quot;         button is pressed, the existing buffer is overwritten with silence.</p>      <p><br>        If you want to store the buffer as sound on the harddisk OR register it         as a bufferPool to use with other ixiQuark instruments, you have to give         it a name and then use the &quot;write&quot; button to write it to harddisk         and register it as a bufferPool. This bufferPool will disappear when you         quit ixiQuarks, but you can of course manually load the sounds into a         new bufferPool.</p>      <p><br>        The draw button is an on/off state of the index line that shows the location         of the playhead. To save CPU in a hectic performance, it could save resources         to switch it off.</p>      </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
