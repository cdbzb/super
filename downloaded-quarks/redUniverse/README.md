a [Quark](http://supercollider-quarks.github.io/quarks/) for [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io)

install it from within supercollider with the command `Quarks.install("redUniverse")` and then recompile.

# redUniverse

physics system. work in progress. happy for any comments or contributions.

**NOTE**: some of the examples require additional classes like RedGA etc. these are available online at my homepage http://www.fredrikolofsson.com under code->supercollider
